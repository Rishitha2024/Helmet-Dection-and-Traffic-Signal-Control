==============================

This dataset was exported via roboflow.ai on January 5, 2022 at 2:12 PM GMT

It includes 3735 images.
Rider-helmet-bike are annotated in YOLO v3 (Keras) format.

The following pre-processing was applied to each image:
* Auto-orientation of pixel data (with EXIF-orientation stripping)
* Resize to 416x416 (Stretch)

The following augmentation was applied to create 3 versions of each source image:
* Random rotation of between -30 and +30 degrees
* Random shear of between -15째 to +15째 horizontally and -15째 to +15째 vertically
* Random Gaussian blur of between 0 and 1.5 pixels
